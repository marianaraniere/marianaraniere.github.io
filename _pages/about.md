I am a Senior Mathematical Modeller at the Department of Health and Social Care and also work part-time as a teaching fellow at Queen Mary University of London. My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Computer Science, along with a bachelor's and a master's degree in Statistics.

During my Ph.D. research, I focused on building Bayesian Network models for managing chronic conditions, specifically Gestational Diabetes. I also explored the impact of AI in clinical decision-making. In addition, I have experience working with R programming, python, sql, github, and SAS.

My interests lie in developing prediction models for medical applications, causal inference, and leveraging data science for social good.
